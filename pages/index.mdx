## What we're building

We’re going to build a point-of-sale web app that allows us to take payments from customers in person. We’ll present a QR code that they can scan with a Solana wallet to make the payment. As soon as they do our app will update to show that they’ve paid. It’s pretty magic, and you’ll see just how easy it is to make it work!

We’re also going to look at online payments in Solana, and build a loyalty card scheme. You can do things like give users a 50% discount on every 5th purchase. Or whatever you like really, it’s super flexible.

(snipped the Why Solana section!)

## What is Solana Pay?

Solana Pay is a specification for payments on Solana. It describes a way to encode a payment request in a URL, which can be displayed to users - for example as a QR code. And Solana mobile wallets support it really well, so users can seamlessly scan that QR code and make the payment.

In short, Solana Pay makes payments work IRL, really well. It works because of those features of Solana: it’s as fast as any card machine, and it’s miles cheaper than any credit card processor.

(Snipped most of setup page, talks through Phantom wallet setup. Assuming we already have a wallet + can create new wallet accounts if needed)

## Get the starter code

You can clone the starter code to start building:

(todo: clone to a solana-labs repo)

```sh copy
git clone -b start https://github.com/pointer-gg/solana-pay-tutorial
```

Make sure you have the `start` branch checked out!

This is a NextJS app. You can run it with npm:

```sh copy
# install dependencies
npm install
# run the app locally
npm run dev
```

By default it’ll run on localhost:3000. When it’s running, open it in your browser and you should see something like:

The starter code gives you a simple store, where we can select some products and make an order! Although that checkout page doesn't quite work yet...

## Customize it

The products displayed are in `lib/products.ts`, feel free to change them if you’d like to sell something other than cookies!

```ts filename="lib/products.ts" copy
export const products = [
  {
    id: "box-of-cookies",
    name: "Box",
    description: "A delicious box of handmade cookies",
    unitName: "box", // shows after the price, eg. 0.05 SOL/box
    priceSol: 0.05,
    priceUsd: 5,
  },
  {
    id: "basket-of-cookies",
    name: "Basket",
    description: "A large basket of handmade cookies",
    unitName: "basket",
    priceSol: 0.1,
    priceUsd: 10,
  },
];
```

If you’re not a fan of the colours, fonts, whatever - it’s your app! Feel free to change whatever you like :)

When you’re happy with the starting code, go on to the next lesson and we’ll start building together!
